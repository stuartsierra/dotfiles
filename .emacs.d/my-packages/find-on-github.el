;; Call browse-on-github to open a web browser showing the current
;; file, at the current commit, on GitHub.com. This assumes that the
;; file is in a Git repository whose "remote.origin.url" property
;; points to github.com. Works for both public (https://github.com)
;; and private (git@github.com) repository URLs.
;;
;; Inspired by https://github.com/gleitz/browse-on-github.el but
;; rewritten without an external script.
